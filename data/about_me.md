# Marouane Faris - React JS Expert

Hello There, my name is Marouane and I am a **React JS** expert with 5 years of experience in frontend web developement.

Above everything else, I like tackling challenging technical problems using my coding abilites.

I also like working with inspiring colleagues that help me grow as a software engineer.

- Typescript
- Redux
- Redux-thunk
- RxJS/Redux-Observables
- Vanilla JS (Up to date with the major additions to the ECMAScript standard since 2015)
- CSS-in-JS (worked with Styled-components and emotion libraries)
- CSS modules
- Vanilla CSS
- Storybook

Although I specialise in *frontend* web developement, I also have working knowledge in backend developement as I have tinkered with Node JS and studied the theoretical foundations of Computer Networking.
